	<h1>Getting Started with OP Config</h1>
		
	<p>
	OP Config is a desktop configuration program for the Open Panzer Tank Control Board (TCB). All the settings of the TCB can 
	be modified in this program. 
	</p>


	<h3>What this Help Includes</h3>
	
	<p>
	The OP Config help files will explain how to connect to the TCB, read and save settings files, and describe the function of each and every setting.
	However, this help file will <i>not</i> cover any of the hardware specific features of the TCB, such as installation instructions, wiring diagrams, or connections 
	to external devices such as	receivers and speed controls. For information on those topics and more, please see the online <a href="http://www.openpanzer.org/wiki/">Open Panzer Wiki</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Brief Overview</h3>
	
	<p>
	When the OP Config program is first opened, all settings are initialized to some default values. If you want to start from a pre-existing 
	collection of settings, you can load an .OPZ file from your computer, or you can connect to the TCB and read the settings that are saved on it. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	When you are done modifying the settings, you must then write them to the TCB in order for them to take effect. You can also save the settings to 
	an .OPZ file on your computer for backup. It can be very useful to save a default settings file after you have completed Radio Setup so you don't 
	need to repeat it for future models. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Updating the settings on the TCB is not the same as updating the firmware on the TCB. Settings are choices you make from existing options. 
	They can change how fast the tank moves, which IR protocol the tank uses for battle, or which controls on your radio are mapped to certain functions. 
	But settings do not change the underlying software on the device, which we call the "firmware." 
	</p>
	
	<p>	
	But we can also update the firmware, for example when new upgrades are released. Firmware updates may change the basic functionality of the 
	device or fix bugs from prior versions. To learn more about updating the firmware, see the instructions for the <a href="firmware.html">Firmware tab</a>. 
	All the rest of the documentation will be related to updating <em>settings</em>.
