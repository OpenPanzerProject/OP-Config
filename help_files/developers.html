	<h1>Information for Developers</h1>
	<p>
	OP Config was written in Qt Creator 3.4.1, based on Qt 5.4.2. <br><br>
	
	Qt is an open-source, cross-platform application framework written in C++. <a href="http://www.qt.io">Learn more about Qt here</a>.<br><br>
	
	As with all Open Panzer software, the code for this application is open source and freely available on the <a href="http://www.openpanzer.org/downloads">Open Panzer.org</a> website.
	</p>

	<!-- NOTE: To get the downloads folder to re-direct to the current download page (http://openpanzer.org/forum/index.php?page=download) I used a server redirect 
	     which is the recommended method. To set it up simply log in to CPanel, go to Domains, Redirects and create the redirect.
