    // 3. Send the init string right away. If we're lucky, DTR won't be set low, and the device will connect on the first try.
    //    After it has sent this first string, sendInit also sets startBlitz to true.
    // 4. Because we know DTR probably *will* be toggled on the first send, we start a second timer called blitzTimer. This timer has two time settings,
    //    FIRST_BLITZ_TIME, and SECOND_BLITZ_TIME. We start with the first one, which is set to some length that should be long enough for
    //    the device to reset if it's going to. This timer is also set to single shot (only happens once).
    // 5. FIRST_BLITZ_TIME expires, and blitzTimer calls sendInit() again. sendInit sends the init string a second time, hoping
    //    to catch the device as it wakes from reboot. But in case it's too early, and because startBlitz is set to true, sendInit
    //    will re-configure blitzTimer as a repeating timer with intervale of SECOND_BLITZ_TIME. This interval is much shorter.
    //    Every time blitzTimer reaches that interval it will keep calling sendInit() (thus "blitzing" the device with our init string
    //    over and over). This continues until the device responds or else our original initTimer expires and we give up trying.
    // 6. If the device does respond at any time, both initTimer and blitzTimer are stopped in readData(). So we only keep blitzing as long as
    //    we need, but no longer.

    //  Yes, it's convoluted, but this is the only way I've found to reliably connect. If issues arise, probably the first thing to try would
    //  be tweaking the values of FIRST and SECOND blitz times, rather than changing the concept generally, which I think is sound.

    initTimer->setSingleShot(true);
    initTimer->start(INIT_TIME);        // 1. Start this first, because sendInit() will only do anything if initTimer is active
    startBlitz = false;                 // 2. We are not ready to blitz, just send the init string once
    blitzTimer->setSingleShot(true);    // 3. Because it probably won't connect, start the blitz timer.
    blitzTimer->start(FIRST_BLITZ_TIME);//    The first time is single shot, second and subsequent times will be configured by sendInit()
    //sendInit();                         // 4. Send the first init string and hope we connect right away. This will also set startBlitz to true

{
    // This SkipWatchdog business is a hack, and I don't like hacks, but I found it necessary.

    // The typical behavior is this: any sentence sent to the device triggers startWatchdog() due to the signal/slot connection
    // between AnyRequest() -> startWatchdog(). The watchdog timer starts and if we don't receive a response to our request
    // before it expires, then we consider comms to be lost.

    // This works brilliantly when communication is one sentence back and forth with each device speaking once and taking turns.
    // But when we request the device to stream us radio data, now the device is speaking many times in a row and the PC is just
    // listening and interjecting occasionally. In this scenario, when the PC requests the device to stop streaming, the device always
    // gets the command, the device stops streaming, and the device always then requests the next sentence. But for some reason, the
    // PC about 8 times out of 10 will miss the "next sentence" response. This causes it to think comms have been lost and disconnect.

    // In much testing I can't figure out exactly why it misses this sentence, but I believe it is because the watchdog timer gets restarted
    // any time data comes in. If the stop command is sent in the middle of an incoming sentence (quite likely because they are streamed
    // non-stop), then the incoming stream sentence will clear the watchdog but the next sentence (the response to the stop request)
    // will start it once again. Of course, if the response is successfuly read the watchdog should be stopped but somehow it is not
    // successfully read. Maybe the PC can't keep up with every incoming sentence...

    // If the PC sends the "stop streaming" command after the streaming has really stopped, then the PC will always receive the response.
    // So one hack around this would  be to send the stop streaming command twice, but I went with this hack instead. We now have
    // a global flag called SkipWatchdog. The stopStreamRadio() function sets the flag to true before sending the command
    // to stop streaming. Even though in startWatchdog() below we don't start the watchdog if skipWatchdog = true,
    // the watchdog timer is almost certainly *already* started because of incoming data from the stream is constantly re-starting it.

    // So we do a second check here when the watchdog timer expires. If SkipWatchdog = true we just set it to false but ignore the
    // timeout.
